Title: Tools to deal with fuzzy numbers in R
Type: Package
Author: Marek Gagolewski <gagolews@ibspan.waw.pl>
Description: FuzzyNumbers is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R.
    It provides S4 classes and methods to deal with Fuzzy Numbers.
    It may be used both by the practitioners (computations of many
    operations on fuzzy numbers, approximation by trapezoidal and piecewise
    linear fuzzy numbers, etc.) but also by the researchers
    in fuzzy numbers theory.
