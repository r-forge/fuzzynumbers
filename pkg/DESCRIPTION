Title: Tools to deal with fuzzy numbers in R
Type: Package
Author: Marek Gagolewski <gagolews@ibspan.waw.pl>
Description: The FuzzyNumbers package provides S4 classes and methods
    to deal with Fuzzy Numbers (computations of operations on FNs,
    approximation by trapezoidal and piecewise linear FNs, etc.).
    It may be used by the practitioners as well as by
    the researchers in FN theory.
